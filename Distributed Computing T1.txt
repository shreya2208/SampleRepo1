Distributed Computing T1
--------------------------
1. Comparative analysis of Cloud, Grid and Distributed Computing on working perspective
- Figure 1: Classification of Distributed Computing 
- Fig.3 Grid Computing Environment 
- Table: Summary according to Paradigms


2. Cloud Computing Virtualization of Resources Allocation for Distributed System {Literature survey paper}
- resource provisioning and virtualization
- cloud computing is a kind of parallel and distributed syatem
- using cc, users lease resources instead of buying
- CHARACTERISTICS OF CC
- IaaS -role-example
- Paas -
- SaaS -
- Main issues: Request execution time and VM availability
- Iaas, Paas, SaaS diagram
- what is CC virtualization: described as a software that lets a single hardware calculating devices to be automatically partioned into multiple devices (VMs)
- diff forms of virtualization: storage, server, appliance, desktop and network
- Traditinal architecture and VM Archi diagram
- Resource provisioning and reallocation: mapping virtualised resources to physical one
- Table: 15 various proposed scheduling algorithms for virtualization of resource allocation
This paper is a review of different existing VM scheduling algorithms and resource allocation techniques

3. Task scheduling techniques in cloudcomputing
